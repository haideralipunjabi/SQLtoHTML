# Background

I have used database in many projects of mine, and am surely going to use them in the future as well. While working with Java for over 2 weeks, I thought to take a break and made this small Python Module, which I might need in the future to convert my databses to HTML and display on this site.


# Usage
Place the .db file in the root directory along with main.py and run main.py

# Tip
The table generated has _"sortable"_ class. Use the generated table along side [Sorttable](http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/) to make a sortable table
